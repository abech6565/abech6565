## Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex Bechler. 
I'm a data scientist and statistician with 10+ years of experience working across multiple areas including risk, product, and marketing. 

I am passionate about helping financial institutions make smarter decisions using data. I believe the most powerful statistical solutions are the ones that can be easily understood and that nothing is more important than telling a compelling story through clear, intuitive visuals.

I enjoy building statistical models, conducting data mining and learning on a complicated dataset, developing business cases, and communicating results through data storytelling. 

Throughout my career I have worked with teams in strategy, credit risk modeling, fraud analytics, product analytics, and statistical forecasting. 

## ðŸ’» Technical Skillset

**Programming Languages**: R, Python, SAS, SQL 

**Technology Tools**: Tidyverse, Tableau/PowerBI, and Shiny

**Skills**: Statistical Modeling (*Linear/Logistic Regression, xGBoost, Random Forest - to name a few*), Monte-Carlo Markov Chains, Financial Modeling

**Certifications** Financial Risk Manager (FRM) - *In progress* 

## ðŸ“Š Featured Projects

Take a look at a few of my projects featured in my [Project Portfolio](https://github.com/abech6565/project-examples). Most of these contain presentations & code examples. 

:star: [Text Mining & Analytics on Complaint Data](https://github.com/abech6565/project-examples/tree/main/Consumer%20Card%20Complaints%20Analysis) 
- Extracted themes from consumer feedback and built compelling visuals. 

:star: [Credit Risk Modeling & Strategy](https://github.com/abech6565/project-examples/tree/main/Credit%20Risk%20Modeling)
- Built a logistic regression and analyzed the cost/benefit of new additions to the model. Quantified tradeoff between predictive improvement and data acquisition cost
- Compared Ensemble Techniques (xGBoost, SVM, Random Forest) with baseline methods such as linear and logistic regression

:star: [Bond Price Simulation with Monte Carlo Markov Chains](https://github.com/abech6565/project-examples/tree/main/Simulation%20of%20Bond%20Prices)
- Used Monte Carlo Markov Chains to model the evolution of bond prices and visualize the stochastic process.

:star: [Three Statement Financial Model](https://github.com/abech6565/project-examples/tree/main/Financial%20Modeling)
- Built an Excel-based financial model projecting balance sheet, income, and cash flow statements for student loan lender $SLM.
