## Hi, I'm Alex Bechler. 
I'm a data scientist and statistician with 10+ years of experience working across multiple areas including risk, product, and marketing. 

I am passionate about helping financial institutions make smarter decisions using data. I believe the most powerful statistical solutions are the ones that can be easily understood and that nothing is more important than telling a compelling story through clear, intuitive visuals.

I enjoy building statistical models, conducting data mining and learning on a complicated dataset, developing business cases, and communicating results through data storytelling. 

Throughout my career I have worked with teams in strategy, credit risk modeling, fraud analytics, product analytics, and statistical forecasting.
